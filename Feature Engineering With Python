Introduction to Feature Engineering and Handling Missing Data.
It is crucial to understand that when solving data science, machine learning, or deep learning projects, the primary requirement is data.
In real-world scenarios, especially when working with companies, you will often encounter messy raw data containing many missing values.

Why Do Missing Values Occur?
Missing values occur when some information is not recorded for a variable. For example, if a survey form is given to a sample of people, some individuals might not feel comfortable filling certain fields and leave them empty. This results in missing data.

There are three main mechanisms by which missing values occur, which we will discuss and demonstrate with examples and code.

1. Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) is a type of missing data mechanism where the probability of a value being missing is unrelated to both observed and missing data. 
In other words, missingness occurs randomly without any systematic reason.

2. Missing at Random (MAR)
Missing at Random (MAR) occurs when the probability of a value being missing depends only on the observed data. 
This means missingness is systematically related to other observed variables.

3. Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
Missing Not at Random (MNAR) is a mechanism where the probability of missingness depends on the value of the missing data itself or unmeasured factors associated with it.
